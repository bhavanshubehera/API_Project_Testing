## 📡 API Endpoints

### Tasks API

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Request Body |
|--------|----------|-------------|--------------|
| `GET` | `/api/tasks` | Fetch all tasks | - |

### Test Types

#### 1. Unit Tests
Test individual components and functions in isolation.

```bash
# Run unit tests only
npm run test:unit

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

**Features tested:**
- Task model validation
- Data type handling
- CRUD operations logic
- Error handling scenarios

#### 2. Integration Tests
Test the interaction between different components, especially database operations.

```bash
# Run integration tests only
npm run test:integration
```

**Features tested:**
- Database connection and operations
- Model-database interactions
- Bulk operations
- Transaction handling (if applicable)
- Performance testing

#### 3. API Tests
Test the complete API endpoints end-to-end.

```bash
# Run API tests only
npm run test:api
```

**Features tested:**
- All CRUD endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Request/response validation
- Error handling and status codes
- Data persistence verification
- Concurrent request handling
- Performance benchmarks

### Running All Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (development)
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with detailed coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests for CI/CD (no watch mode)
npm run test:ci
```

### Coverage Analysis

After running tests with coverage, you can:

1. **View HTML Report**: Open `coverage/lcov-report/index.html` in your browser
2. **Check Console Output**: Coverage summary is displayed after test completion
3. **Run Coverage Analysis**: `node scripts/coverage.js`

## 📊 Test Coverage

Our testing achieves **70%+ code coverage** across:

- **Statements Coverage**: 75%+
- **Functions Coverage**: 80%+
- **Branches Coverage**: 70%+
- **Lines Coverage**: 75%+

## 🚦 Testing Strategy

### Mocking vs Non-Mocking Approaches

**Non-Mocking Tests** (Integration & API Tests):
- Use MongoDB Memory Server for real database operations
- Test actual data persistence and retrieval
- Validate complete request-response cycles
- Ensure real-world scenario compatibility

**Mocking Tests** (Unit Tests):
- Mock database operations for isolated testing
- Test business logic without external dependencies
- Faster execution and more predictable results
- Focus on function behavior and edge cases

### Test Coverage Goals

1. **Critical Path Coverage**: 100% coverage of main CRUD operations
2. **Error Handling**: Test all error scenarios and edge cases
3. **Data Validation**: Ensure proper input validation and sanitization
4. **Performance**: Test response times and concurrent request handling
5. **Security**: Validate input sanitization and prevent injection attacks

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### Running Tests During Development

```bash
# Start test watcher for continuous testing
npm run test:watch

# Run specific test types during development
npm run test:unit    # Quick feedback on logic changes
npm run test:api     # Test API changes
npm run test:integration  # Test database interactions
```

### Pre-commit Testing

Before committing code, always run:

```bash
npm run test:ci
```

This ensures all tests pass and coverage requirements are met.

## 🐛 Debugging Tests

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **MongoDB Connection Issues**
   ```bash
   # Ensure MongoDB Memory Server is properly installed
   npm install --save-dev mongodb-memory-server
   ```

2. **Test Timeouts**
   ```javascript
   // Increase timeout in jest.config.js
   module.exports = {
     testTimeout: 30000 // 30 seconds
   };
   ```

3. **Coverage Not Meeting Requirements**
   ```bash
   # Run coverage analysis for detailed breakdown
   node scripts/coverage.js
   ```
